# Front-End Challenges

Welcome to my workshop about how to become a Front-End developer. The best way to learn is by practicing and resolve some exercises about the topics that we have seen.

You should [fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/), in order to send me your solution, so you must to [create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) and assign me as reviewer in order to give you my feedback.

You must create a folder named with your username inside of `challenges` folder located in root of this repo and you need to add a folder for each solution.

### 2. sass-challenge

You should create a button builder to create different types of buttons dynamically according to a bunch of colors.

For example, we have the colors: `red`, `blue` and `orange` so your code must allow us to generate the styles needed to create the following kit of buttons:

![button-builder](resources/button-builder.png?raw=true "button-builder")

Also, you need to take into consideration three different sizes of buttons and a modifier block.

**Points to evaluate:**

- variables
- partials
- mixins
- interpolation
- extend
- each
- map
- list
